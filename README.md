## Description 

<!-- A Node.js command-line interface (CLI) application that takes information about employees in a software engineering team and dynamically generates an HTML file based on user input that displays a summary for each person. A unit test for every part of the application's code is included to ensure the application code is maintanable. Check out the example team-html
[`here!`](https://github.com/emiliatrentham/OOP-team-profile-generator/blob/main/dist/team.html)  -->

## Installation

<!-- To generate a new team profile, install node and npm :

dev-dependencies:

- [jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest)


To start the application, run `node index.js` in the command line and answer the prompts that generate a new file.


## Usage 

Upon initialization, the application uses the `inquirer` package to prompt the user or manager to enter the following information about the team manager: name, employee ID, email address, and office number.

Subsequently, the manager's information is added and pushed to the repository, the user is then presented with a menu with options to add more team members, i.e., Engineer and/or Intern, or to finish assembling their team. In which case, the user will exit the application and an HTML file containing the user input will be rendered.  -->
